```{r data import}
chaff <- read_table2("../data_raw/chaff.txt")
```
```{r}
chaff2 <- chaff %>% pivot_longer(names_to = "sex",
                             values_to = "mass", cols = "everything"())
chaff2

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
